# Customer-Segment-Prediction

Present a R Markdown document in which you demonstrate the use of K-NN and logistic regression on the wholesale.csv dataset.
Compare the k-NN to the logistic regression model and answer the following questions throughout the document:<br />
- What is your accuracy? Was the logistic regression better than K_NN in terms of accuracy? (recall the lesson on obtaining an unbiased estimate of the model’s accuracy)<br />
- Was the logistic regression better than our K_NN model at explaining which of the variables are good predictors of a customer’s industry?<br />
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of k-NN and logistic regression?<br />

As guidance for a good result as following:
1.	The document demonstrates the accuracy of both approach <br />
2.	The document demonstrates explanations of the accuracy of a model and how it is better than the other<br />
3.	The document demonstrates 1 disadvantage and 1 strength of each of the approach (K_NN and logistic regression)<br />

The data set refers to clients of a wholesale distributor. It includes the annual spending in monetary units (m.u.) on diverse product categories which are through a distribution network consisting of hotel, restaurany, cafes, and all variety of retail outlets. <br />
Build an algorithm that automatically sort our customers into one of two segments:
- Horeca: Short for Hotel, Restaurant and Cafe  <br />
- Retail: Retail industry  <br />

The dataset originated from a dataset prepared by Margarida Cardoso (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) and comprise of 8 variables as following:<br />
**Channel, Regional, Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Deterents_Paper, Delicassen**.<br />
 (the explanation of these variables is in “Data Explanation” sub-section)
